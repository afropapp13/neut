-- The base for this release was 5.2.0_130622 (SF-including)
[found in t2k.org, based on work by A.Furmanski]
To this release were added all modifications and data for MEC 
(data include the HE-extension) provided by P.Sinclair/A.Redij


-- There are some modifications and extra helper files that need 
to be purged.

-- Take care of hardcoded paths!
in:
neutsmpl/Makeneutsmpl.csh
neutspmpl/EnvMakeneutsmpl.csh
neutsmpl/GNUMakefile.neutroot
neutgeom/GNUMakefile
neutgeom/setup.sh


-- The compiling of specfunc is a kludge.
We need to either:
a. Create an Imakefile that will allow it to work in the same way 
as other subdirectories of src/ [important for downstream programs to
find Linux_pc with all object files and libraries]
b. create soft links of all .F source files to neutcore, so that 
they are included in compilation


-- 'ExtraLibs' in neutgeom has to be included in the setup.sh or the 
GNUmakefile


-- I tried to include all modification logs I found; I did not add any.
If your mod-log is missing, many apologies!

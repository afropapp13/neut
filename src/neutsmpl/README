   TO BUILD NEUT LIBARIES AND NEUTRINO PROGRAMS

1) set the following environment variables
   CERN, CERN_LEVEL and ROOTSYS

2) change directory to neutsmpl

3) Modify neutsmpl/config/site.def

      If you are using 32bit version of linux, you need to change
      the line 121 as follows:

      SITE_LDOPTIONS += -L/usr/X11R6/lib

4) run " Makeneutsmpl.csh "
      This script try to compile all the necessary libraries and
	  sample programs "neut" and "neutroot"
	  Previously, you needed to specify M_A values for the quasi-elastic
	  and single pion productions before compilation. Now, you must 
	  specify in neut.card.

5) run " neut_qema1.1.sh neut.card " or " neut_qema1.2.sh neut.card " or
       "neut_qema1.1.sh neut.card "
   depending on your selected configuration.
      They are the script files to run neut. The file "neut.card" 
      specifies various configurable parameters.
      This program does not generate output file, though.

6) run " neutroot neut.card output.dat "
      This is a program to generate vector files in the root format.
	  This program geneartes a file named neutvect.root .
      You can access the result file (neutvect.root) by using
	  chkreadneutroot.cc script.

      In order to run neutroot, you need to have cross-section files.
	 ( Please take look at the files Makeneutsmpl.csh or 
       neut_qema1.?.sh to make proper symbolic links. )

	NOTE: NEED TO ADD SINGLE-PI CROSS SECTION FILES TO LINKING
	      SCRIPTS

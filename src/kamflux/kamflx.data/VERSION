 Notes:                                                                                             
 In the data set, neutrino fluxes of 1-10,000TeV are given,                                         
 but actual integration is from 10GeV to 100TeV for primary CR.                                     
 Only the flux in the 3-1,000GeV is reliable (I hope).

The systematic error due to the primary flux is estimated 5% below 100GeV                           
and 10% at 1TeV. However, there always is systematic error of absolute                              
values. This should be fixed by mu-on flux and/or BESS observation.

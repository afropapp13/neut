README for SK ATMPD Tauola directory.

Please update if you change Tauola


====================
* Fix to tauola parent/child identification

  Must initialize NP1 and NP2 in common block /TAUPOS/ both to 1 in subroutines DEKAY, DEXAY
      
  - By default tauola assumes tau+ is in position 3 and tau- is in position 4
  - For SK, both are always in position 1.
  - This mistake causes some particles to not be simulated.

Tauola source and versions
====================
Look Here:

Links to old versions can be found here:
http://hpjmiady.ifj.edu.pl/programs/node6.html

Do *not* use these.  The versions in this directory are from 1994 and
1995.  In 2004 our code was updated to the 1995 version (taola 2.6)

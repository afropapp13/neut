Code to pre-compute the cross section for DIS related modes
Updated Dec. 2020 (C. Bronner)

* Start by building the code using 'make all'
(for some reasons 'make' runs 'make clean', feel free to fix if you know how to)

* Then needs to build for each card file considered the table of cross section for each target nucleon and neutrino target.
Script "submit_sukap.sh" shows an example to do this for the card files in the folder CardFiles, submitting jobs to the Kamioka cluster

* Finally need to merge the different tables for each card file into tables for proton target and proton+neutron. Script "Merge_all.sh" shows an example for all the card files in the folder CardFiles

The folder CardFiles should have all the card files needed to compute the standard DIS cross sections used in NEUT.

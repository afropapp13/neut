This folder contains cross-section integration routines for the single pion models in NEUT

** FILES **
crs_newff calculates the Rein-Sehgal single pion cross-section tables using simple trapezium integration

crs_newff_adap calculates the Rein-Sehgal single pion cross-section tables using quadpack integration techniques

crs_min_adap calculates Minoo Kabirnezhad single pion cross-section tables using quadpack integration techniques

** USAGE **
These cross-section tables

** HOW TO MAKE **
1) set CERN and CERN_LEVEL environment variables
2) It will assume NEUT/src is located two levels up and requires NEUT to be built
3) make clean && make
4) Run executable of your choice and enjoy the physics!
